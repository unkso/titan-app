# Modules
There are certain features that *must* exist for Titan to function properly. Examples of these include login/logout, user management, permissions, settings, etc. These features are closely coupled and depend on each other to be functional. We call the implementation of these features a `module`.
 
 It is important to understand that a feature should only be implemented as a module if the core of titan is incomplete without it. Optional plug-and-play features should be implemented as an `extension`.
